<h3>Soft computing</h3>
		<div class="indent cite">
	Soft computing constructs computationally intelligent methods 
	by combining emerging problem solving technologies such as 
	fuzzy logic, probabilistic computing and reasoning, 
	artificial neural networks, evolutionary algorithms, and
	reinforcement learning
	to solve complex and real world problems.
	Various methods used in soft computing are neither independent of nor compete with one another, 
	but rather, they work in a cooperative and complementary way.
	Soft computing is tolerant of imprecision, uncertainty, partial truth and approximation
	(Bhattacharyya, D.K. and Kalita, J.K., 2014. 
	Network anomaly detection: A machine learning perspective. Chapman and Hall/CRC).
	<br>
	Nowadays, when data has large-scale potencial with Volume, Velocity, Variety and Veracity characteristics, 
	the proper combination of large-scale data preprocessing, in-memory operations, 
	intelligent soft computing methods with high-performance supports
	is practical to face challenges in many areas. All of these advanced technologies mentioned above 
	do not have to be always coupled together, but the alliance is essential for complex solutions

	A heuristics approach to mine behavioural data logs in mobile malware detection system.
