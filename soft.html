<h3>Soft computing</h3>
		<div class="indent cite">
	Applied soft computing constructs computationally intelligent methods 
	by combining emerging problem solving technologies such as 
	fuzzy logic, probabilistic computing and reasoning, 
	artificial neural networks, evolutionary algorithms, and machine learning
	to solve complex and real world problems.
	Various methods used in soft computing are neither independent of 
	nor compete with one another, but rather, 
	they work in a cooperative and complementary way.
	Soft computing aims to tolerance of imprecision, uncertainty, partial truth 
	and approximation to achieve effectiveness and low solution cost
	(http://www.softcomputing.org).
	<br>
	When today data has dynamic and scalable potencial 
	with Volume, Velocity, Variety and Veracity characteristics, 
	the proper combination of intelligent soft computing methods 
	with scalable data preprocessing, and high-performance backgrounds
	is practical to face challenges in many areas. 
	All of these advanced technologies mentioned above 
	do not have to be always coupled together, 
	but the alliance is essential for complex solutions.
