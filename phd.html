<h3>Adaptive monitoring with artificial intelligence</h3>
	<div class="indent">
The topic of the thesis is focused on research of adaptive network monitoring and workload management with AI technology such as machine learning, deep neural networks and/or nature-inspired optimization. Various methods will work adaptively and precisely within predefined time constraints. The topic is also focused on dynamic and growing data, which requires paying attention only to certain aspects. The work is closely related to scalable and/or stream processing in-situ. PhD students choose one of the two domains: cyber-security or workload management.

<h3>Collaborative learning with sensitive data protection</h3>
        <div class="indent">
Many modern-world problems, which we want to solve with the help of AI, require direct access to sensitive information such as personal, medical, business  or  security  information. In  many  cases,  getting  access  to such information  is  nearly  impossible due to the protection requirements. From this point, several questions are raised, such as how to avoid sensitive information disclosure in the data science process or moreover, how can we model sensitive data without direct access to them. The topic of the work is focused on collaborative (federated) learning, where it is necessary to ensure knowledge sharing between partners, while ensuring the protection of sensitive data at the same time.

<h3>Sequence modelling with context-aware attention</h3>
        <div class="indent">
The most exciting advances in data science using intelligent methods are thanks to dynamic and growing amounts of data, which also raise new challenges. Unless the data is not labelled, it remains essentially useless for many applications relying on supervised learning. Since unlabeled instances are easy to obtain, winning the AI race comes through a flexible and scalable way of obtaining quality training datasets automatically. Another challenge related to dynamic and growing data is to pay attention on certain aspects while devoting the rest to less weight. The thesis will focus on active learning with attention mechanisms. It relates to a context-aware approach for sequence to sequence modeling.

<h3>Sentiment analysis in text</h3>
        <div class="indent">
The thesis topic is focused on methods for sentiment analysis in text resources, which is a research subfield of natural language processing (NLP). It can be opinion mining, product reviews, microblogs or from news articles in order to get overview information, or the opinion spectrum respectively in given contexts. The thesis will continue from the state-of-the-art, it will design and validate appropriate methods applicable also to Slovak language. However, the topic is not limited to one specific language but may also explore methods suitable for other languages or among languages. The topic is closely related to recommender systems (RS), which offer a variety combination of modern approaches such as NLP, machine learning, deep learning as well as scalable data processing.

<h3>Soft computing for complex solution</h3>
        <div class="indent">
The thesis topic is focused on the research in soft computing (SC), which constructs computationally intelligent methods by combining edge technologies such as machine learning, neural networks, deep learning as well as optimization, fuzzy logic, and probabilistics to solve a domain problem (e.g., network monitoring, resource management) in complex way. Various methods used in soft computing are neither independent of nor compete with one another, but rather, they work in a cooperative and complementary way. Soft computing aims to tolerance of imprecision, uncertainty, partial truth and approximation to achieve effectiveness and low solution cost.
When today data has large-scale potential with <a href="https://www.bbva.com/en/five-vs-big-data/">many V's</a> characteristics, the wider collaboration between intelligent methods, scalable data processing and high-performance backgrounds is practical to face challenges in many areas. All of these advanced technologies do not have to be always coupled together, but the alliance is usually essential.

PhD study is considered an equivalent to full time employment and in the majority of cases cannot be combined with another employment. 
<a href="#" class="blue" onClick="return false;">Doktorandské štúdium je ekvivalent práce na plný úväzok a vo väčšine prípadov nie je vhodné ani možné absolvovať denné doktorandské štúdium v kombinácii s iným pracovným úväzkom.</a> 
V prípade štúdia popri zamestnaní je vhodné voliť externú formu štúdia.
Povinnosti doktorandov zahŕňajú podiel na pedagogickej činnosti na univerzite.
