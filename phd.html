<h3>Soft computing for dynamic and complex systems</h3>
        <div class="indent">
The topic is focused on soft computing, which constructs computationally intelligent methods by combining edge technologies such as machine learning, neural networks, and deep learning to solve complex domain problems like network monitoring, resource management. Various methods used in soft computing are neither independent of nor compete, but rather, they work in a cooperative and complementary way. Soft computing aims for tolerance of imprecision, uncertainty, partial truth, and approximation to achieve effectiveness and low solution cost. When today data has large-scale potential with many V's characteristics, the wider collaboration between smart data-centric AI methods, scalable data processing, and high-performance support is practical to face challenges in many areas. All of these advanced technologies do not have to always merge, but the alliance is essential.

<h3>Adaptive monitoring with artificial intelligence</h3>
	<div class="indent">
The topic of the thesis is focused on research of adaptive network monitoring and workload management with AI technology such as machine learning, deep neural networks and/or nature-inspired optimization. Various methods will work adaptively and precisely within predefined time constraints. The topic is also focused on dynamic and growing data, which requires paying attention only to certain aspects. The work is closely related to scalable and/or stream processing in-situ. PhD students choose one of the two domains: cyber-security or workload management.

<h3>Machine learning and sensitive data protection</h3>
        <div class="indent">
Many modern-world problems, which we want to solve with the help of Artificial Intelligence, require direct access to sensitive data such as personal, medical, business, or security information. In many cases, getting access to such information is nearly impossible due to the protection requirements. From this point, several questions are raised, such as how to avoid sensitive information disclosure in the data science process or moreover, how can we model sensitive data without direct access to them. The topic of the work is focused on collaborative (federated) learning, where it is necessary to ensure knowledge sharing between partners, while ensuring the protection of sensitive data at the same time.

<h3>Probabilistic context-aware learning</h3>
        <div class="indent">
The most exciting advances in Artificial Intelligence are thanks to the dynamic and growing amounts of data, which also raise new challenges. Since raw instances are easy to obtain, winning the AI race comes through a flexible and scalable way to obtain quality training datasets by learning data representations with higher levels of abstraction automatically. Unless the data is not labeled, it remains essentially useless for many applications relying on supervised learning. Another challenge related to dynamic and growing data is to pay attention to certain aspects while devoting the rest to less weight. The thesis will focus on probabilistic learning with context-aware attention for smart-size data-centric modeling.

<h3>Sentiment analysis in text</h3>
        <div class="indent">
The thesis topic is focused on methods for sentiment analysis in text resources, which is a research subfield of natural language processing (NLP). It can be opinion mining, product reviews, microblogs or from news articles in order to get overview information, or the opinion spectrum respectively in given contexts. The thesis will continue from the state-of-the-art, it will design and validate appropriate methods applicable also to Slovak language. However, the topic is not limited to one specific language but may also explore methods suitable for other languages or among languages. The topic is closely related to recommender systems (RS), which offer a variety combination of modern approaches such as NLP, machine learning, deep learning as well as scalable data processing.

<h3>Soft computing for complex solution</h3>
        <div class="indent">
The thesis topic is focused on the research in soft computing (SC), which constructs computationally intelligent methods by combining edge technologies such as machine learning, neural networks, deep learning as well as optimization, fuzzy logic, and probabilistics to solve a domain problem (e.g., network monitoring, resource management) in complex way. Various methods used in soft computing are neither independent of nor compete with one another, but rather, they work in a cooperative and complementary way. Soft computing aims to tolerance of imprecision, uncertainty, partial truth and approximation to achieve effectiveness and low solution cost.
When today data has large-scale potential with <a href="https://www.bbva.com/en/five-vs-big-data/">many V's</a> characteristics, the wider collaboration between intelligent methods, scalable data processing and high-performance backgrounds is practical to face challenges in many areas. All of these advanced technologies do not have to be always coupled together, but the alliance is usually essential.
