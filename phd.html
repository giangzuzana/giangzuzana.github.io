<h3>Artificial Intelligence for IT Operations</h3>
        <div class="indent">
The topic is focused on AI for IT operations, which constructs and apply computationally intelligent methods and advanced technologies to solve complex problems in dynamic systems. Various methods used in the thesis are neither independent of nor compete, but rather, they work in a cooperative and complementary way. The aim is to challenge the dynamics and imperfection in IT operations to achieve effectiveness and low solution cost. When today data has large-scale potential with many V's characteristics, the wider collaboration between smart data-centric AI methods, scalable data processing, and high-performance support is practical to face challenges in many areas. All of these advanced technologies do not have to always merge, but the alliance is essential.

<h3>Privacy and Fairness in Machine Learning</h3>
        <div class="indent">
Many modern-world problems, which we want to solve with the help of Artificial Intelligence, require direct access to sensitive data such as personal, business, or security information. In many cases, getting access to such information is nearly impossible due to privacy protection requirements. From this point, several questions are raised, such as how to avoid sensitive information disclosure in the data science process or moreover, how can we model sensitive data under privacy and fairness conditions. The topic of the work is focused on federated learning, where it is necessary to ensure knowledge sharing among partners, while ensuring data privacy and reliability at the same time.

<h3>Context-Aware Active Learning</h3>
        <div class="indent">
The most exciting advances in Artificial Intelligence are thanks to the dynamic and growing amounts of data, which also raise new challenges. Since raw instances are easy to obtain, winning the AI race comes through a flexible and scalable way to obtain quality training datasets by learning data representations with higher levels of abstraction automatically. Unless the data is not labeled, it remains essentially useless for many applications relying on supervised learning. Another challenge related to dynamic and growing data is to pay attention to certain aspects while devoting the rest to less weight. The thesis will focus on probabilistic learning with context-aware attention for smart-size data-centric modeling.
